# Enchantment-Transfer
**Enchantment Transfer** is a lightweight mod for both Forge and Fabric which allows the player to transfer enchantments from item to book at the cost of XP.

**Why use this mod?**
Fair Play - Replicates the Vanilla anvil calculations to ensure a fair XP requirement for any transfer

Configurable - Want to cut the XP cost in half or set it to a fixed amount of levels no matter what? How about a limit for how many enchantments transfer? You can do all of that in the mod's config!

Vanilla Friendly - Adds ZERO (0) Items, Blocks, or Ores

Up to Date - Supports Minecraft 1.20.1 on both Forge and Fabric.

Modpack Friendly - You are free to use this mod in any modpack as long as you link them in the comments below!

NOTE:

Free anvil transactions are not natively supported by Minecraft, so they do not work in this mod. Setting the fixed XP level to 0 will still cost 1 XP level.
